## Week 3 Personal Log [Sept 15 – Sept 21, 2025]

This week I contributed to multiple parts of our project’s requirement specification document:

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Helped define performance expectations, such as efficiency and reliability of artifact mining.  
- Specified scalability goals (e.g., system should handle large catalogs and use CPU cores efficiently).  
- Contributed to usability requirements including accessibility, onboarding, and responsiveness.  
- Outlined key security measures (encryption, least-privilege access, secure deletion).  
- Added maintainability standards such as automated test coverage, documentation updates, and CI checks.  
- Ensured privacy considerations were included (local-only analysis, redaction of sensitive data, idle lock).  

### Data Requirements
- Specified supported file types (code, text, PDF, images, audio, video, design files).  
- Defined metadata fields to capture (path, name, size, timestamps, owner).  
- Added hashing/deduplication requirements using SHA-256 for integrity checks.  
- Defined storage formats (SQLite or JSON with indexing).  
- Included data quality checks and conflict reporting.  
- Outlined export formats (CSV/JSON) and data volume limits (≥5 million artifacts).  

### Technical Requirements
- Proposed use of SQLite or JSON with write-ahead logging for local storage.  
- Defined cross-platform build requirements (Windows, macOS, Linux).  
- Added support for Git repository metadata extraction.  
- Specified JSON API on localhost for modular design.  
- Required metadata extraction from media files (dimensions, duration, codec).  
- Defined Unicode/path handling requirements.  
- Proposed concurrency model using worker pools with back-pressure.  
- Specified configuration handling through user settings and environment variables.  

### Reflection
This week I gained a stronger understanding of how detailed requirements shape the foundation of a project. I learned the importance of balancing **functional scope with non-functional qualities**, and how technical and data requirements ensure the system is both practical and scalable. Writing these sections gave me experience in thinking not just about what the system should do, but how it should behave under real-world conditions.
